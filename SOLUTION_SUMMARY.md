# ✅ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED - CI/CD Fixes

## Summary of All Issues Fixed

### 🔧 **Problem 1: Laravel Pint Not Found**

```bash
Error: vendor/bin/pint: No such file or directory
```

**Root Cause**: Build job used `--no-dev` flag, so Laravel Pint wasn't installed.

**✅ Solution**:

-   Modified build job to install with dev dependencies: `composer install --optimize-autoloader`
-   Created new streamlined `main.yml` workflow
-   Separated testing and production build concerns

### 🔧 **Problem 2: PHPUnit Unknown --verbose Flag**

```bash
Unknown option "--verbose"
```

**Root Cause**: PHPUnit 11.x doesn't support `--verbose` flag.

**✅ Solution**:

-   Removed `--verbose` flag from all PHPUnit commands
-   Using `vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml` instead

### 🔧 **Problem 3: Database Schema Error (Previously Fixed)**

```bash
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 table users has no column named name
```

**✅ Solution**:

-   Fixed UserFactory to use `nama` instead of `name`
-   Added proper authentication methods in User model

### 🔧 **Problem 4: Deprecated GitHub Actions (Previously Fixed)**

```bash
deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3
```

**✅ Solution**:

-   Updated all actions to latest versions (v4)

### 🔧 **Problem 5: NPM Cache Issues (Previously Fixed)**

```bash
Dependencies lock file is not found
```

**✅ Solution**:

-   Generated `package-lock.json`
-   Updated workflows to use `npm ci` and proper caching

## 🚀 NEW WORKFLOW STRUCTURE

### **main.yml** - Primary CI/CD Workflow

```yaml
Jobs:
1. tests (runs on all branches)
   - ✅ PHP setup with Xdebug
   - ✅ Composer install (with dev)
   - ✅ NPM install & build
   - ✅ Laravel setup
   - ✅ Database migrations
   - ✅ PHPUnit tests with coverage
   - ✅ Laravel Pint formatting check
   - ✅ Security audit
   - ✅ Upload coverage to Codecov

2. build (runs only on master/main after tests pass)
   - ✅ Production Composer install (--no-dev)
   - ✅ NPM build for production
   - ✅ Laravel optimizations (config/route/view cache)
   - ✅ Create deployment artifact
   - ✅ Upload build artifact
```

### **Other Workflows**

-   `ci.yml` - ✅ Updated and working
-   `deploy.yml` - ✅ Updated to use Main CI/CD workflow
-   `quality-gates.yml` - ✅ Pull request quality checks
-   `laravel.yml` - ❌ Removed (replaced by main.yml)

## 🧪 CURRENT TEST STATUS

```bash
PHPUnit 11.5.27 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
.......                                                             7 / 7 (100%)
Time: 00:00.650, Memory: 40.50 MB
OK (7 tests, 13 assertions)
```

**Laravel Pint**: ✅ PASS - 43 files, all formatting correct
**Security Audit**: ✅ PASS - No vulnerabilities found
**Database Migrations**: ✅ PASS - All tables created successfully
